Trie implementaion:
	Implemented a trie using two classe TrieNode and Trie
	TrieNode consists of insert and suffix functions
	Trie class consists of insert word and find functions


Inserting a char:O(1)
Suffixes: O(m^n) m->max no of elem n->levels

Inserting a word:O(n)
prefix:O(n)


Space Complexity: O(n) Overall

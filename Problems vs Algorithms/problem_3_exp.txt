Rearrange array elements:
	Here i sorted the elements using merge sort with complexity of nlogn
	 in order and splited even index into one list and odd indexes into another so as to form to largest numbers
	used two lists for forming two different digits
	used a join function to join digits of the lists  to form a number

Time Complexity:O(nlogn) n is input size
Space Complexity:O(nlogn)

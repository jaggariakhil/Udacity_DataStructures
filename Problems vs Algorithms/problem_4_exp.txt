Rearrange array elements:
	Here i used to pointers for zero elemts index and digit2 elements index to keep track o them 
	gradually sorted all the zero elemets to start and 2digit elements last so the problem gets sloved
	
	here the trick is if we sort all the zero elements to left side and all the 2's to right side 
	the 1's get automatically sorted to the center
Time Complexity:O(n) n is input size
Space Complexity:O(n)

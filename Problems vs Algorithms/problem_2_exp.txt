search algorithm:
	Here i have used a recursive binary search for finding index if its found in left side it returns directly else also checks the right part
	used a recursivebinary search algorithm to get a complexity of O(logn)
	Used two functions binarysearch and recursive binary search
	It will recursively solve the problem until the base condition (low<high) is true	

Time Complexity:O(logn) n is input size
Space Complexity:O(1)

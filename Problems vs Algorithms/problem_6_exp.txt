Max and Min:
	Here used two pointers max an min and traced the array to find the minimum and maximum numbers and returned it
	The algorithm traced all the elememts in the array
	intially the minvalue and maxvalue are intialised to null
	when a first value of array encounters both are initialized with first values of array
	later they are compared with every value of array to give final ouput

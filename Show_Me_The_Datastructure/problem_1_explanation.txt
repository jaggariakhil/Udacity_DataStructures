LRU CACHE:
	LEAST RECENTLY USED CACHE 
The get and put operations for lru cache can be best implemented by using dictionaries which internally use hash function , soo the complexity is alwya O(1) for both
get and set operations
Here  i used a python list to keep trcak of elements and used functions append and pop with complexity O(1)

Space Complexity:O(n) I.e the capacity of list

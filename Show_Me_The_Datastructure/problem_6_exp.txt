Union and intersection of Linked list:

Union:Used a set to find intersection and appended it to a new linked list

Time Complexity:O(n) (n is the input sum of total number of elements in both linked lists)

( where n is is overall number of elements in both the linked list(i.e we iterate only once through both the linked lists)


Space Complexity:O(n)

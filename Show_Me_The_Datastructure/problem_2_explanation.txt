File Recursion:
	Here we need to find all the .c files in all the folders and subfolders of given path
		

	so i used recusrion which takes suffix and a path in which we need to traverse to find all the .c files.
	I used a list to append all the .c files

Time Complexity :O(n) for worst case where each path is a directory

Space Complexity: Depth of list=K
			NO of function calls:n
				spacecomplexity(Kn)
